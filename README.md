## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

  * Java Development Kit (JDK 21 or later)
  * Apache NetBeans IDE (Version 21 or later)
  * Apache Tomcat Server (Version 9.0 or later)
  * MySQL Server & MySQL Workbench

### Installation Guide

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bigul222/ECommerceApp.git
    cd ECommerceApp
    ```

2.  **Set Up the Database**

      * Open MySQL Workbench and create a new database schema. Name it `ecommerce_db`.
      * Inside this schema, you'll need to create the necessary tables for users, products, orders, etc. You can do this by running an SQL script.
        *(**Note:** You should create and include a `database.sql` file in your repository with the table creation commands for others to use.)*

3.  **Configure the Project in NetBeans**

      * Open Apache NetBeans IDE and select `File > Open Project`. Navigate to the cloned `ECommerceApp` folder.
      * Locate the database configuration file (e.g., a `DBConnection.java` or `context.xml` file).
      * Update the database URL, username, and password to match your local MySQL setup.

4.  **Deploy and Run**

      * Configure the Apache Tomcat server in NetBeans if you haven't already (`Services` tab \> `Servers` \> `Add Server`).
      * Right-click the project and select **Run**. NetBeans will build, deploy the project to Tomcat, and open it in your default web browser.
      * The application will be available at: `http://localhost:8080/ECommerceApp/`
